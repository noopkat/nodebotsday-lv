# Nodebots Day Las Vegas Code of Conduct

Nodebots Day Las Vegas is a community hackathon movement and series of events, intending to provide an inclusive and fun environment to experiment and demo cool projects.

We value the participation of each member of the maker/designer/coder/artist/enthusiast community, and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the hackathon and at all hackathon events, whether officially sponsored by Nodebots Day Las Vegas or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, judges, organizers and volunteers at any Nodebots Day Las Vegas event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

## The Short Version
Nodebots Day Las Vegas is dedicated to providing a harassment-free hackathon experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any hackathon venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Nodebots Day Las Vegas.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the hackathon without a refund at the sole discretion of the hackathon organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## The Longer Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material in their presentations, marketing material, or swag handouts. Sponsor staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for Nodebots Day Las Vegas.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the hackathon organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon with no refund.

## Contact Information
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff. Hackathon staff will be present at all times, and will introduce themselves at the beginning of the event. Their immediate contact details will also be shared on the day of the event to attendees.

Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.
